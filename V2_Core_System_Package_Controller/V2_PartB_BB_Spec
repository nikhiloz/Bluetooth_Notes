General :
* many more slaves can remain connected in parked state.

* EDR: Access code, Header, Gaurad, Sync, Payload, Trailer
* Access code n Header are modulated as according to Basic Rate Scheme.
* Guard Time Allows for the transition between modulation modes

Bluetooth Clock:
* For synchronization with other devices offsets are used.
* native clock is derived from free running system clock.
* 28bit counter is used.
* LSB ticks in unit of 312.5 micro seconds , 3.2 khz
* 4 periods important: 312.5 , 625, 1.25, 1.28 : CLK0, CLK1, CLK2, CLK12

Access Codes:
* Device Access Code (DAC)
* Channel Access Code (CAC)
* Inquiry Access Code (IAC)
* Access codes are derived from LAP of device address or Inquiry Address
* Device Access Code used in : Page, Page scan and Page response substate and derived from paged device's BD_ADDR
* Channel Access Code used in CONNECTION STATE n form begining of all pakcets on piconet physical channel
* CAC is derived from LAP of master
* IAC used in Inquiry substate : 1 GIAC , 63 DIAC
* Access code indicates to the receiver the arrival of packets: timing synchronization , offset compensation
* Receiver correlates against the entire syncronization word in access codes, robust signalling

Physical Channels:
* characterized by : Pseudo Random FHS + Specific Slot Timing of Txmission + Access Code + Pakcets Header Encoding
* for the basic n adapted piconet physical channels : Frequency hopping is used to change frequency periodically
* 4 Bluetooth Channels defined : Basic piconet n Adapted Piconet : physical channel : Connected Device
* Remaining : Inquiry Scan Channel , Page Scan Channel for Inquiry and Connecting
* Only one phycial channel can be used by device at a time:
* Whenever device is Synchronized : Timing + Frequency + Access Code of Physical Channel: It is Connected
* Hopping Sequence is determined by UAP and LAP of BD_ADDR and Selected Hopping sequence
* Phase in the hopping Sequence is determined by the Bluetooth Clock
* Hop Selection kernel : 1600 H/S in Connection State and 3200 H/S in Inquiry n page substate
* Adapted piconet physical channel can be used if AFH Enabled

Basic Piconet Physical Channel:
* Hopping characteristic: Frequency hopping is determined by blutooth clock and BD_ADDR of master
* When the piconet is established, the master clock is communicated to the slave
* Each slave will add an offset to its native clock to synchronize with master clock
* All device participating in the piconet are time-synchronized hop-synchronized to the channel.
* the offsets in the slaves must be regularly updated such that CLK is approximately CLKN of the master.
* Slaves maintain an estimate of the master’s native clock by adding a timing off- set to the slave’s native clock
* This offset shall be updated each time a packet is received from the maste
* The listening periods shall be exactly timed 625 us after the corresponding paging packets, and shall include a +- 10 us uncertainty window.

Hop Selection:
* 6 types of hopping sequence defined: 5 for the basic and 1 for AFH
* Page Hopping Seuqnece 32 wakeup frequencies : Distributed equally over 79 channels
* Page Response Hopping Seuqnece : 32 response frequencies in 1 to 1 correspondance to current page hopping sequence
* Inquiry Hopping Sequence : 32 wakeup freuqnecies
* Inquiry Response Hopping Sequence : 32 Response frequencies
* Basic Channel Hopping Sequnece : Distributed equally over all 79 freuqnecies
* Adapted Channel Hopping Sequence : Less than 79 Frequncies

General selection Scheme:
* Selecting a Sequence
* Mapping this Sequence to hop frequencies
* Sequence Selection: 
	- Page Scan
	- Inquiry Scan 
	- page
	- Inquiry
	- master page response
	- slave page response
	- inquiry response
	- Basic channel
	- Adapted channel

* UAP/LAP : 28 bits : 24 bits of LAP + 4 LSB of UAP

* When the basic or adapted channel hopping sequence is selected, the Bluetooth device address of the master (BD_ADDR) shall be used
* When the page, master page response, slave page response, or page scan hopping sequences are selected the BD_ADDR given by the Host of the    paged device shall be used
* When the inquiry, inquiry response, or inquiry scan hopping sequences are selected, the UAP/LAP corresponding to the GIAC shall be used even if it concerns a DIAC.
*Whenever one of the reserved BD_ADDRs is used for generating a frequency hop sequence, the UAP shall be replaced by the default check initialization

** REGISTER BANK:
The registers are loaded with the synthesizer code words corresponding to the hop frequencies 0 to 78. Note that the upper half of the bank contains the even hop frequencies, whereas the lower half of the bank contains the odd hop frequencies
