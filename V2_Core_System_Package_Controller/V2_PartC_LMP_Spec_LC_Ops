Link Controller Operations:

* 3 Major States: Standby : Connection : Park
* 9 Substates :Page , page scan, Inquiry, Inquiry Scan, Synchronization Train, Synchronization Scan, Master Response, Slave Response, Inq Res
* Standby state : Device remains in Low Power mode

Connection Establishment Substate:

	- To Establish New Connection: Paging pr Synchronization scan procedure is used
	- Only the BD_ADDR is required to initiate connection (via Paging procedure)
	- Knowledge about the clock would just accelerate the setup
	- Device using sync-scan procedure does so in 2 steps: 
	- synchronization scan procedure gives: Clock , Packet Timing, AFH Channel Map Information
	- From STANDBY to Connectionless slave broadcast

* Page Scan Substate
	-In the case of a standard scan, if the correlator exceeds the trigger threshold during the page scan, the device shall enter the slave 	 response substate
	- 
* Page Substate
* Page Response substate
	- Slave Response substate
	- Master Response substate


Device Discovery Substate:
	- Device shall enter Inquiry state : Transmit Inquiry Message (ID Packets)
* Inquiry scan substate
* Inquiry substate
* Inquiry response substate

Connection State:
* Exceptioon - connectionless slave broadcast mode
* Uses : Basic or adapted channel hopping sequence
* 2 ways to enter: one via page/page scan
* 2nd, Directly via STANDBY STATE to connectionless slave broadcast mode of the CONNECTION STATE
* if via Paging -- Master sends POLL Packet to verify to the switch to master timing , slave may respond any type packet
* if slave doesnt found POLL packet or master doesnt found acknolwedgement packet for newconnectionTO slots, both return to page state
