Service Level Connection Release :

	- Either the HF or AG shall initiate the Service Level Connection release‖ procedure due to an explicit user request.
	- The Service Level Connection release‖ procedure shall be initiated if the Bluetooth functionality is disabled in either 		  the HF or AG.
	- The Service Level Connection release‖ procedure may be initiated if an ―Audio Connection transfer towards the AG‖, as 	  stated in section 4.11, is performed during an ongoing call in the AG. In the case that the Service Level Connection is 		  removed, the AG shall attempt to re-establish the Service Level Connection once the call is dropped

*	The AT+CMER command, as described in Section 4.2, enables the Signal strength Indication‖ function in the AG.
*	The AT+BIA command, as described in Section 4.2, allows the HF to deactivate/reactivate individual indicators.

*	When the CMER function is enabled and the indicator has not been deactivated by the AT+BIA command, the AG shall send the 	  +CIEV unsolicited result code with the corresponding signal strength indicator and value whenever the
