- Generic Object Exchange Profile defines : Protocol and Procedure used by application providing the Usage Model

- Synchronization Model
- File Transfer Model
- Object Push Model


1. Bluetooth IrDA Interoperability Specification [1]
	• Defines how the applications can function over both Bluetooth and IrDA.
	• Specifies how OBEX is mapped over RFCOMM and TCP.
	• Defines the application profiles using OBEX over Bluetooth.

2. Bluetooth Generic Object Exchange Profile Specification (This specification)
	• Generic interoperability specification for the application profiles using OBEX.
	• Defines the interoperability requirements of the lower protocol layers (e.g.Baseband and LMP) for the application profiles.

3. Bluetooth Synchronization Profile Specification [2]
	• Application Profile for the Synchronization applications.
	• Defines the interoperability requirements for the applications within the Synchronization application profile.
	• Does not define the requirements for the Baseband, LMP, L2CAP, or RFCOMM.

4. Bluetooth File Transfer Profile Specification [3]
	• Application Profile for the File Transfer applications.
	• Defines the interoperability requirements for the applications within the File Transfer application profile.
	• Does not define the requirements for the Baseband, LMP, L2CAP, or RFCOMM.

5. Bluetooth Object Push Profile Specification [4]
	• Application Profile for the Object Push applications.
	• Defines the interoperability requirements for the applications within the Object Push application profile.
	• Does not define the requirements for the Baseband, LMP, L2CAP, orRFCOMM.

Profile Fundamentals: 
	- for first time : Bonding must be performed
	- In addition to link level bonding : an Obex Initilization procedure may be performed
	- Encryption and Authentication support : depends on application
	- no master slave role
	- no low power mode

Application Layer :
	Feature Overview :
		Establishing an Object Exchange Session
		Pushing a data Object
		Pulling a Data Object



Obex Operation Used :

	- Connect - disconnect - put - get - abort - setpath


Initlialization of OBEX :

	- 
Establishment of OBEX Session :

	-

LC Interoperatibility Requirements :

	- HV1 , DV Packet mandatory
	- HV2, HV3 Optional
