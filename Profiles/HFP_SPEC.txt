COmpliance with this specification assures interoperatibility between a Bluetooth enabled hands-free device & any bluetooth equipped mobile phone

Service level connection:
	- synchronized high-level protocol connection involving a portion of the protocol stack. In this specific case, it refers to 		  the presence of a RFCOMM connection, and assumes that the HF has synchronized itself to the state of the AG using the 	  specified Service Level Connection initialization procedure

Service level connection Initialization:
	- it means the execution of the set of AT commands and responses specified by the profile necessary to synchronize the state 		  of the HF with that of the AG

Service Level Connection Establishment:
	- it means the combined process of establishing the RFCOMM connection, as well as the necessary device synchronization using 		  Service Level Connection initialization

Synchronous Connection:
	- it means a SCO or eSCO logical link intended for supporting a full duplex Audio Connection

Audio Connection:
	- it means a Synchronous Connection including the means to provide a complete audio path between two devices assuming roles 		  within this profile

Codec Connection:
	- Synchronous Connection established after profile level negotiation of Codec and related configuration

User Requirements / Scenarios :
	- Profile mandates CVSD for transmission of Audio over bluetooth link
	- Between HF unit & gateway , only one Audio connection per service level connection is supported 
	- It should always be the AG that establish the Synchronous COnnection with required codec
	- whenver Audio Exists , a related "Service Level Connection shall" also exist
	
Service level connection establishment:
	- Service level connection Initialization:
		- HF to AG : AT + BRSF = < HF Supported feature > 
		- AG to HF : +BRSF: < AG Supported feature >
		- AG to HF : OK

		- INFO: (Optional) HF Notifies the AG about its available codec if it supportes codec negotiation feature
		- HF to AG : AT + BAC = < HF Available codecs >
		- AG to HF : OK

		- INFO: HF retrieves the information describing the indicators supported in AG
		- HF to AG : AT + CIND = ?
		- AG to HF : +CIND: ...
		- AG to HF : OK

		- INFO: HF requests the current status of the indicator in AG
		- HF to AG : AT + CIND?
		- AG to HF : +CIND: ...
		- AG to HF : OK

		- INFO: HF requests enabling status indicator update in the AG
		- HF to AG : AT + CMER = 
		- AG to HF : OK
		
		- INFO: HF retrieves the information describing  the call  hold  and multiparty services supportin AG
		- HF to AG : AT + CHLD = ?
		- AG to HF : +CHLD: ...
		- AG to HF : OK



The HF shall consider the Service Level Connection fully initialized/established ,if:

	- After the HF has successfully retrieved information about how call hold and multiparty services are supported in the AG 		  using the AT+CHLD command, if and only if the "Call waiting and 3-way calling" bit was set in the Supported Features 		  attribute of the SDP records for both HF and AG.

	- After the HF has successfully enabled the Indicator status update using the AT+CMER command, if and only if the "Call 	  waiting and 3-way calling" bit was not set in the Supported Features attribute of the SDP records for either the HF or the 
	  AG

The HF shall consider the Service Level Connection fully initialized/established ,if:

	- After that the AG has successfully responded with information about how call hold and multiparty services are supported in 		  the AG using +CHLD as well as responded OK, if and only if the "Call waiting and 3-way calling" bit was set in the 		  supported features bitmap for both HF and AG.

	- After the AG has successfully responded with OK to the AT+CMER command (to enable the Indicator status update function), if 		  and only if the "Call waiting and 3-way calling bit" was not set in the supported features bitmap for either the HF or the 		  AG
