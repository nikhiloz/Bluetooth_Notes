Host Controller Interface Functionality Specification:

	- A Primary Controller is Either -- BR/EDR Controller , BR/EDR/LE Controller or an LE Controller
	- The Host Controller driver (which interfaces to the Controller) should be independent of the underlying transport technology

HCI FLow Control:

	- Flow Control of data shall be used in the direction  from the host to the controller to avoid oevrflowing the controller data buffer
	- Host manages the data buffers of the controller
	- for Primary controller ; packet based flow control is default
	- for AMP Controller, data block based data flow control is the default ACL traffic 

HOST TO CONTROLLER DATA FLOW CONTROL:
	- 2 methods of data flow control (packet based , data block based) , called buffer management.
	- Selection is performed by "Write Flow Control Mode Command"
	
	</TEXT>

	If a BR/EDR/LE Controller implements separate buffers for ACL Data:

	1. The Host shall use the LE Read Buffer Size command to determine the buffers that are used for ACL Data on an LE-U logical link.
	2. The Host shall use separate packet based flow control for each set of buffers.
	3. The Connection_Handle contained in the ACL Data packet shall be used by the Controller to determine which set of buffers to use 
	and the logical link (ACL-U or LE-U) over which the data is to be sent.

	If a BR/EDR/LE Controller does not implement separate buffers, then all ACL Data shall use the BR/EDR buffer management as 
	described below, and only the logical link (ACL-U or LE-U) shall be determined by the Connection_Handle

	<TEXT/>

	- Packet based Data Flow Control
	- Data-block-based data flow control

CONTROLLER TO HOST DATA FLOW CONTROL:
	- The Set Host Controller To Host Flow Control command can be used to turn flow control on or off in that direction
	- For AMP : Controller to Host data flow control is provided by HCI Physical transport or software equivalent
	- Host buffer size command to notify the controller about maximum size of HCI ACL and SYNC data packets sent from Controller to Host.
	- 2 additional params : to notify the total num of ACL and Synchronous data packets that can be data buffered in Host
	- Host uses : Host Number of Completed Packet Command

Disconnection Behaviour: 
	- when Host Receives : Disconnection Complete , Disconnection physical link complete, Disconnection Logical Link Complete
	- Host shall assume that all unacknowledged data packets have been flushed & corresponding data buffers have been freed.
	- A primary controller doesnt have to notify about this to host via any means
	- Nor Does the AMP Controller have to notify this to the host
	- Even if flow control is enabled from controller to host: controller may assume that host has flushed data buffers for the sent handle

Command Flow Control :
	- Power on: Host shall send maximum of 1 outstanding HCI command packet untill complete or status has been received.
