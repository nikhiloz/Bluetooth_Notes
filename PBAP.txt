- Defines Protocol and procedures that shall be used by device for retrival of phone book objects
- based on Client Server Interaction model where the client device pulls the Phone book Object from server

- Specially tailored for handsfree usage case (in accordance with HFP and SIM)
- This profile only allows for the consulation of phone book objects (Read Only)
- Dependencies: If it uses the other part of profile : GOBEXP + SPP + GAP


Profile Stack:- BB, LMP and L2CAP are OSI Layer1 & Layer2; RFCOMM is Bluetooth Serial Port Emulation Entity; 

Configuration & Roles :- 
	PSE (Phone Book Server Equipment)
	PCE (Phone Book Client Equipment)

Profile Fundamental : 
	- Only after successful creation of secure connection
	- BOND ; Initialization Including PIN; Creation of link key; Encryption and Service Discovery (SDP)

Bluetooth Security :
	- 2 Device shall create a secure Connection using GAP Authentication Process
	- Bonding : Security mode 2 or 3 shall be used
	- Encryption : Encryption should be enabled
	- PASSKEY : Prohibit the use of zero length passkey
	- Linkeys : Combinational Key should be used (not unit key)
	- Encryption key length : 64 bits , for increased security use as per regulation says
	- User Confirmation :PSE has to confirm at least once for each new PCE

Application layer :
	- Phone Book Objects
	- Phone book Object Representations :
	- Phone book entries format : PSE Shall support : vCard 2.1 or vCard 3.0 ; Char Set - UTF-8
