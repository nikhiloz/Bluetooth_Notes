SECURITY MODE:

	- Legacy Security Mode :

		- Security Mode 1 (non-Secure)

			- In security mode 1 it will never initiate any security procedure
			- it will never send LMP_au_rand, LMP_in_rand or LMP_encryption_mode_req

		- Security mode 2 (Service level Enforced Security)

			- It will not initiate any security procedure before a channel establishment request
			- Security procedure initiated/No: Depends on the security requirements of the requested channel or service
			- It is a special case of security mode 2 where no service has registered any security requirements

				• Authorization required
				• Authentication required
				• Encryption required

		- Security mode 3 (Link Level Enforced Security)

			- In Security mode 3 it will initiate security procedures before it sends LMP_setup_complete
			- A BT Device in security mode 3 may reject the host connection request based on settings in the host

	- Security mode 4: (Service Level Enforced Security)
		- Security mode 4 shall classify the security requirements of its services using at least the following attributes

		• Authenticated link key required
			- Either numeric comparison, out-of-band, or passkey entry simple pairing association models used.
			- It has protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

		• Unauthenticated link key required
			- An unauthenticated link key is a link key where the just works Secure Simple Pairing association model used
			- It Doesnt have protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

		INFO: A profile or protocol may define services that require more security or no security.
		
		INFO: When both devices support Secure Simple Pairing, GAP shall require at least an unauthenticated link key and 			enabling encryption for all connections except those allowed to have security level 0
	
		INFO: A Bluetooth device in security mode 4 shall respond to authentication requests during link establishment when 			the remote device is in security mode 3 for backwards compatibility reasons

		INFO: A Bluetooth device in security mode 4 enforces its security requirements before it attempts to access services 			offered by a remote device and before it grants access to services it offers to remote devices

		CASE: Security for Access to Remote Service (Initiating Side)

			- When the responding device does not support Secure Simple Pairing, it may disconnect the link while the 				  initiating device is requesting the PIN to be entered by the user

			- This may occur due to the lack of an L2CAP channel being present for longer than an implementation-specific 				  amount of time (e.g., a few seconds). When this occurs, the initiating device shall allow the user to 			  complete entering the PIN and shall then re-page the remote device and restart the pairing procedure

		CASE: Security for Access to Local Service by Remote Device (RespondingSide)

			- When a remote device attempts to access a service offered by a Bluetooth device that is in security mode 4 				  and a sufficient link key exists and authentication has not been performed the local device shall 				  authenticate the remote device and enable encryption after the channel establishment request is received 				  but before a channel establishment confirmation (L2CAP_ConnectRsp with result code of 0x0000 or a 				  higher-level channel establishment confirmation such as that of RFCOMM) is sent.

			- When L2CAP is the channel establishment protocol being used for the requested service, an L2CAP_ConnectRsp 				  signaling packet shall be sent by the responding device containing the result code 0x0001 (connection 			  pending) following receipt of an L2CAP_ConnectReq and prior to initiating security procedures which can 				  result in prompting the local user for input (e.g., pairing using a PIN or Secure Simple Pairing using 				  either the Passkey entry or Numerical Comparison association models). This will stop the L2CAP RTX timer on 				  the remote device (which may be as short as 1 second) and will invoke the ERTX timer on the remote device, 				  which is a minimum duration of 60 seconds

			• Level 3, for services with the following attributes:
				MITM protection required
				Encryption required
				User interaction acceptable

			• Level 2, for services with the following attributes:
				MITM protection not required
				Encryption required

			• Level 1, for services with the following attributes:
				MITM protection not required
				Minimal user interaction desired

				One additional level is permitted for L2CAP fixed signaling channels (CIDs 0x0001, 0x0003 and 					0x003F),SDP and for some service traffic sent via the connectionless L2CAP channel for services that 					do not require security but shall not be used for any other service traffic:

			• Level 0: Service requires the following
				MITM protection not required
				No encryption required
				No user interaction required

			NOTE: Level 0 may only be used for Services with the following Service Class UUIDs: 0x1000 + BASE_ID (Service 				Discovery Server)
			
		• Security optional – SDP only. Limited to specific services
