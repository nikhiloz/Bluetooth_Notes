L2CAP FEATURES:
	- Protocol Channel Multiplexing, Segmentation and Reassembly, Per channel Flow Control, Error Control & QOS
	- Interfaces with uppper layer protocol
	
General Operation:
	- Channel Identifiers:
		- 01 L2CAP signalling channel
		- 05 LE L2CAP Signalling channel  
		- 06 SMP Channel
		- 04 Attribute Protocol
		- 03 AMP manager Protocl
		- 02 Connectionless channel
		- 3F AMP Test Manager
		- 40 - FFFF Dynamically Allocated

	- Modes of Operation: During Configuration Procedure modes are enabled
		- Basic L2CAP Mode
		- Flow Control Mode
		- Retransmission
		- Enhanced Retransmission
		- Streaming 

	- Mapping channels to logical Links:
		- L2CAP maps channels to controller logical link , which in turn run over Controller Physical Links
		- BR/EDR : All Best Effort and Guaranteed Channel between BR/EDR Controller mapped to single ACL-U Logical Link
		- AMP    : All Best Effort one AMP-U and Each Guaranteed is its own AMP-U
		- LE     : All are best effort only and mapped to one LE-U logical link

		- Creation of a Guaranteed logical link involves admission control. 
		- Admission control is verifying that the guarantee can be achieved without compromising existing guarantees. 
		- AMP:  L2CAP shall tell the controller to create a Guaranteed logical link & admission control is done by the Controller. 
		- BR/EDR : admission control (creation of a Guaranteed logical link) shall be performed by the L2CAP layer
