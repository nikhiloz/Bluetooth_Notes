AUDIO/VIDEO DISTRIBUTION TRANSPORT PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION

* Audio / Video Stream requires isochronous data transmission capabilities
* Transport mechanism of this profile is based on RTP
* RTP transfer protocol (RTP): RTP Control protocol (RTCP)
* A/V Streams are transmitted in Pseudo-Isochronous L2CAP Channels.
* Signalling provides Stream Discovery, Configuration, Establishment, and transfer Control

STACK OVERVIEW:
* AVDTP exposes 3 interface to the upper layer and 2 interface to Bluetooth Stack
* AVDTP Performs AV parameter negotiation


Architectural Interface:
* IFACE1 : SDP Message iface used to discover bluetooth attributes from a distant device.
* IFACE2 : Application iface used to exchange reporting packets  of the stream  b/w 2 interconnected devices (QOS reporting)
* IFACE3 : used to exchange signalling messages for stream setup phase, reconfiguring and tear down.
* IFACE4 : A/V elementry media packet . Media packet format is defined at Profile Level.
* IFACE5 : L2CAP channel for signalling . PSM Value = AVDTP
* IFACE6 : L2CAP channel for transport of media Packet

Functional Requirements :
* Means to discover capabilities of devices
* mechanism to establish n tear down a stream
* mechanism to minimize transmission delay
* mechanism for reporting QOS and status of transport of media packets to the application
* mechanism to optimise the available bandwidth
* Provide recovery mechanism
* provide mechanism to reduce the overhead of headers

Terminology and Definition :
* Stream represents the logical end to end connection of streaming media data.
* As Streams are unidirectional media data, the peer devices explicitly assumes the roles of either SRC n SNK depending on the application

Service Category: represents the top-level structuring element. 
	- media transport
	- reporting
	- media recovery
	- media codec
	- content protection
	- robust header compression
	- multiplexing mode 

Service Parameters: Service Category can comprise of one or multiple Service params
	- SBC
	- Sampling frequency
	- Channel Mode

Media packets - Recovery packets - Reporting Packets :
	- Depending on the supported services, the peer AVDTP entities can exchange further information
	- Recovery packets containing recovery data are sent by the SRC
	- If QoS reporting is used, information is encapsulated in reporting packets

SEP (Stream End Point)
	- The Stream End-Point (SEP) is a concept to expose available Transport Services and AV capabilities of the Application in order to 		   negotiate a stream. 
	- The Application registers its SEPs in AVDTP in order to allow other devices to discover and connect to them

Signalling Procedure:
	- Stream End Point Discovery
	- Get Capabilities Procedure
	- Stream Configuration Procedure
	- Stream Establishment Procedure
	- Stream Start Procedure
	- Stream Suspend Procedure
	- Stream Reconfiguration Procedure
	- Stream Release Procedure

Signal Command Set:
	- AVDTP_DISCOVER
	- AVDTP_GET_CAPABILITIES
	- AVDTP_SET_CONFIGURATION
	- AVDTP_GET_CONFIGURATION
	- AVDTP_RECONFIGURE
	- AVDTP_OPEN
	- AVDTP_START
	- AVDTP_CLOSE
	- AVDTP_SUSPEND
	- AVDTP_SECURITY_CONTROL
	- AVDTP_ABORT
