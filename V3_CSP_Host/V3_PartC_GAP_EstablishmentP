Establishment Procedure:

	Device is aware of:

	• The Bluetooth Device Address (BD_ADDR) from which the Device Access Code is generated;
	• The system clock of the remote device;
	• The page scan mode used by the remote device.

	Additional information provided during device discovery:

	• The Class of device;
	• The Device name;
	• The supported Service Classes.

Link Establishment :

	- Both devices may perform link setup (using LMP procedures that require no interaction with the host on the remote side). 		  
	- Optional LMP features can be used after having confirmed (using LMP_feature_req) that the other device supports the feature

	- When the paging device needs to go beyond the link setup phase, it issues a request to be connected to the host of the 		  remote device. If the paged device is in security mode 3, this is the trigger for initiating authentication.

	- The paging device shall send LMP_host_connection_req during link establishment (i.e., before channel establishment) and may 		  initiate authentication only after having sent LMP_host_connection_req.

	- After an authentication has been performed, any of the devices can initiate encryption.

	- Further link configuration may take place after the LMP_host_connection_req.

	- When both devices are satisfied, they send LMP_setup_complete.

	- Link establishment is completed when both devices have sent LMP_setup_complete

Channel Establishment :

Connection Establishment :

Establishment of additional Connection :

	• A second connection on the same channel, and/or

	• A second channel on the same logical link, and/or

	• A second physical link.
